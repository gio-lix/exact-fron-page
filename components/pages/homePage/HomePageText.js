                        The test libraries and tools we have developed over the years apply to various business
                        contexts, from regulated markets to MTFs, from dark pools to clearinghouses and brokerage
                        systems. They have been successfully implemented in a wide range of technical and middleware
                        infrastructures.

                        Modern exchange platforms are highly sophisticated by design and require continuous testing to
                        ensure their resilience

                        Our Deliberate Practice of Software Testing approach is based on modelling the system under
                        test, which allows us to create test libraries that serve as an executable specification for
                        such highly complex platforms. This is a deliberate practice, meaning that it is systematic and
                        focused on achieving the specific goal of improving performance.

                        Instead of relying on a fixed data subset, we constantly strive to widen the testing scope.
                        Instead of confining the test scope to a limited number of requirements, we have learned to see
                        the system under test as something that evolves and changes over time, and is not a static sum
                        of its parts.

                        Software testing is relentless learning. The best software testing instrument is the human
                        brain.

                        We create a mental model of the system (the Theory of Everything), implement it in the code
                        (Build Software to Test Software) and use it to produce a multitude of relevant test scenarios
                        and their expected outcomes.
